	1. There are many foods. Some are easy to get and some are hard to get. Here
are some basic foods that is the most common. Before I tell you the foods, you need
to know: you have food points. If you run out if food points, then you lose health 
until you die. Cooked foods give you nore food points than non-cooked food. To cook
food, you need a furnace (see crafting to know how to craft a furnace).
	2. The easiest food to find is meat. you get it by killing animals. If you 
don't want to kill animals then get fruits and vegtables(see gardening to get them).
If you don't have a garden, then go fishing.
	3. To go fishing, you need to make a fishing rod. To make it, fill in the 
3rd row with sticks. Place a stick in the middle, then place a stick on the left 
bottom corner. To fish, throw your bobber out. When you see a stream of bubbles 
apear close to your bobber, get ready. When the bobber goes down, immediently pull
 your bobber up. You should get fish. If your lucky, you will get another item. If
you get fish, then cook it in your furnace. Then, you will get cooked fish!
